As part of our NoVA Transit Dashboard refresh, NVTC sought out to redefine our access to transit and access to jobs methodology used in the dashboard. This document will cover the analysis parameters used in the Access to Opportunity analysis.

The Access to Opportunity analysis measures how many jobs and destinations residents can reach using public transit within specific time limits. The core research question driving this analysis is: "How many jobs can a resident of Northern Virginia reach on a given day of the week at a specific time of day within a certain travel time using transit?"

## Travel time analysis

### Travel time limits

We analyze three travel time limits: 30 minutes, 45 minutes, and 60 minutes. These time limits were chosen to capture different types of transit trips:

* **30 minutes** - Local trips within immediate communities
* **45 minutes** - Medium-distance trips to major employment centers  
* **60 minutes** - Longer commutes that still represent reasonable transit travel times
* **90 minutes** - Long-distance commutes from the farthest reaches of the region, often made using commuter bus services

Together, these time limits cover the majority of feasible transit trips within the Northern Virginia region.

### Times of day

We analyze three departure times that represent different travel patterns throughout the day. Each time represents the start of a 60-minute window during which trips can begin:

* **7:00 AM** - Morning peak period, capturing commute trips to work
* **12:00 PM** - Midday period, representing non-work trips like shopping, appointments, and services
* **9:00 PM** - Evening period, capturing return trips and evening activities

These times were selected to reflect the major periods when people use transit for different purposes, from work commutes to personal errands.

### Days of week

We analyze three types of service days that reflect different transit operating patterns. The specific dates will vary depending on the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) schedules provided by each agency, but the service patterns remain consistent:

* **Wednesdays** - Typical weekday service with full schedules and highest frequency
* **Saturdays** - Weekend service with reduced schedules but broader span of service
* **Sundays** - Sunday/holiday service with the most limited schedules (many agencies use Sunday schedules for federal holidays)

This approach captures the full range of transit service levels that residents experience throughout the week.

## Geographic scope

The analysis examines travel from specific starting points (origins) to potential destinations. This geographic framework is essential for understanding regional transit connectivity.

### Origins

All origins are located within the NVTC district[^1]. By keeping origins consistent across all analyses, we can answer the central question: "How many jobs can a Northern Virginia resident reach on a specific day of the week, at a particular time, within a given travel time using transit?"

### Destinations

The destination area extends beyond the NVTC district to include the broader metropolitan area where Northern Virginia residents commonly work and access services. This expanded area includes:

* The NVTC district
* The District of Columbia (major employment center)
* Montgomery and Prince George's Counties in Maryland (regional employment and services)

This broader geographic scope recognizes that transit users often cross jurisdictional boundaries for work and other activities, making regional connectivity a key measure of transit effectiveness.
